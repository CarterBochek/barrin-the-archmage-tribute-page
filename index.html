<!--  This will be a Tribute Page about Barrin, the Tolarian Archmage. He is a very prestigious teacher and scholar from the multiverse of Magic the Gathering. Once reknowned as a great wizard, he was lost in the echoes of time and space within the multiverse. Defending the academy, he used all the life and power he had left to obliterate everyone and everything threatening his home. Promising never to cast this forbidden spell, everything was gone in a blink of an eye.  -->
